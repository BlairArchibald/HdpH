HdpH ChangeLog

Version 'IFL11_final' (06 May 2012)

* This version largely corresponds to what is described in the IFL 2011
  paper [1] and includes code for the benchmarks reported in the paper.
  The main difference to the paper are the workarounds to emulate the
  'Static' type (which GHC does not yet provide), see module HdpH.Closure
  for details.

      Memory Parallel Haskell in Haskell. Proceedings of IFL 2011, Springer.

  benchmarks reported in that paper.
