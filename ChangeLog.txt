HdpH ChangeLog

Cabal packages hdph-0.0.1 and hdph-closure-0.0.1 (06 Feb 2013)

* In directory 'release'.

* The package hdph-0.0.1 uses TCP rather than MPI for networking. This isn't
  a long term solution but rather a quick fix until some issues with the
  previous MPI binding are resolved.


Version '2012-07-27' (27 Jul 2012)

* This version is mostly identical to 'IFL11_final'. Apart from a few
  small updates, there is only one major change: The support for the
  explicit 'Closure' type has been factored out so that it can be
  compiled and used separately from HdpH. Along with this goes a complete
  rewrite of the support for 'Static', moving its implementation closer
  to how it would be realised in the compiler.

* There are minor API changes in modules HdpH.Closure and HdpH.Strategies.
  The most significant difference to 'IFL11_final' is the removal of all
  'Typeable' constraints from these modules.


Version 'IFL11_final' (06 May 2012)

* This version largely corresponds to what is described in the IFL 2011
  paper [1] and includes code for the benchmarks reported in the paper.
  The main difference to the paper are the workarounds to emulate the
  'Static' type (which GHC does not yet provide), see module HdpH.Closure
  for details.

Version 'IFL11_submit' (30 Nov 2011)

* This version is described is some detail in the IFL 2011 post-proceedings
  submission (available from the authors' web pages). Also contains code for
  benchmarks reported in that paper.
